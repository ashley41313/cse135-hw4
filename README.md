I created the analytics portion of this project using React, I too the single-page application path. 
It was hard to merge the SPA portion of my project with the previous part, with the static /index /images /tables pages, so I create a link in the nav bar of those pages to the analytics SPA.
They are hosted on different domains, but keep the same server side cookies, so I’m able to keep tracking the user information and can still accurately differentiate users. The only difference is the domain. 

Here is the link to the analytics portion: 
https://analytics-a336c.firebaseapp.com/login

Link to the actual website that collects data: 
https://homework-4-f09d0.firebaseapp.com/

^ the nav bar here has a link to the analytics SPA, click on that and continue…
I've set it up so that my account is on admin, this will be visible for the final submission, but not on this turn-in.
